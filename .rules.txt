This note has made everything clear to you that all your sorrows can be cured if you complete this quest presented to you through this mysterious note.

You must change the directory to Level1 by using the cd command. For example, enter "cd Level1", then use the command "./level1.sh" to start the maze. 
To travel through these mazes, you must say "move", and then, use WASD to move in directions. Enter the commands "a” to move left, “d” to move right, “w” to move up, and “s” to move down. Then, press "x" to return to your other options. If you need to leave the maze at any point while in the options section type and enter "rest" to take a break from the maze.

On the maze there will be different symbols to represent what is located in the maze. 
The letter "P" represents the player.
The letter "C" represents a character that you can interact with.
The letter "N" represents a note that you can interact with.
The Letter "E" represents the exit to the maze."

As you traverse through these mazes there will most certainly be new skills that you will learn that will help you complete your quest.

For example, to get started try typing and entering these commands in this order:

cd Level1
./level.sh
move
d
s
w
x
rest
