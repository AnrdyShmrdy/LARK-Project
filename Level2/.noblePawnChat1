The Noble Pawn: Hello peasant, I shall grant you the ability to materialize items by using a command called touch. Now if you wish for me to let you pass you must show me that you have mastered this power that I have bestowed upon you by creating an Apple.
For example, after you take a rest say

touch Apple

Then, use the ls command to confirm that you have created the Apple by saying:

ls

Then, once you have completed these tasks return yourself to me…
