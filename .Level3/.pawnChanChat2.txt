Pawn Chan: Thank you so much for finding that note! Could you show me your moves by using this new command called cp? I want you to use the cp command to copy the note’s information onto this long pillar.

After you take a well-deserved rest say

cp pawnChansNote ./Pillar/pawnChansNote

Then, please come back to me baka!
