The Nobler Pawn: I will bestow upon you the power to move objects to other levels/directories by using the command mv.
I desire for you to now use your powers of creation to create a Pawn and then send that Pawn to meet The Noble Pawn that you met in Level1. Once you take a rest you should say

touch Pawn

Then, you should say

mv pawn ../Level1 

Once you have completed this task, I shall let you pass…
